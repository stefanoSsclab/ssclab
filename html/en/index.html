			<div class="commento">
			
			SSC (Software for the Calculation of the Simplex) is a java library for solving  linear 
			programming problems. SSC uses the Simplex algorithm for solving this class 
			of optimization problems normally indicated with the initials LP 
			(Linear Programming).
			<p>In SSC you can solve problems with free variables, integer, binary and <span class="alfa">semi-continuous</span>.  
			This subclass of problems are usually named with the initials MILP 
			(Mixed Integer Linear Programming). For MILP problems, which have 
			all or part of integer or binary or semi-continuous variables, SSC uses the algorithm 
			of Branch and Bound (B&B) for their resolution.</p>
			
			<p>Starting from version 2.1. it is possible to perform an implementation of the 
			<span class="alfa">parallel simplex</span>. This option (see example <a href="esempi.html#ese1_14">1.14</a>) makes it possible to exploit multiple 
			threads for the simulation of the simplex and is of significant advantage in the case 
			of architectures with at least 4 or more physical cores.
			
			Starting from this version it is also possible to perform an implementation of 
			the  <span class="alfa">parallel Branch and Bound </span>
			(see example <a href="esempi.html#ese2_13">2.13</a>). In this case, the duration advantages are also obtained starting from two physical cores.

			<div class="commento">
			
			The simplex method can 'be divided into two phases. In phase 1 is identified a basic 
			feasible solution, while in the phase 2 is identified an optimal solution. The procedure 
			manages free variables, bounded variables bottom and top and the different ranges 
			of constraints. If they are not explicitly specified lower limits, 
			 SSC considers the variables to be not negative. 
			<P>In SSC when a variable is defined as an integer variable or binary, the procedure 
			uses the algorithm of Branch and Bound for optimization. The Branch and Bound 
			resolves a succession of relaxed problems (deprived of integer constraints); 
			to solve these problems is used the Simplex algorithm.</P>

				<h3 class="paragraph_title">Size of problems and memory request</h3>
			<div class="commento">
			
			The simplex method implemented in SSC is very efficient because we tried to optimize all the steps 
			of the algorithm itself. The problems that can be solved with SSC have no limits in the number of 
			variables and constraints, the limits are given by the jvm memory availability. For example, if you 
			tell the jvm to make available a maximum quantity of 4 Gigabytes of memory (using the -Xmx4g declaration) you can solve problems 
			with tens of thousands of variables and thousands of constraints.  
			<P>On the contrary, the Branch and Bound method is not very efficient; there are methods in the 
			literature that are certainly much more efficient from the point of view of computational complexity 
			and in the use of memory (for example Branch and Cut and Price). Consequently the size of the 
			MILP problems it must be limited.

			<h3 class="paragraph_title">Technical requirements</h3>
			<div class="commento">
			
			The requirement to perform the SSC program is to be able to have a JDK (or SDK) java version 8.x or higher. 
			No other requirement is requested.
